# About Me

• 👋 Hey, I'm Zayd, but you can call me by whatever you better know me as.

• 💻 I'm a Python coder, Doom modder and a shit web designer.

• 🏳️‍⚧ I hate being a boy, and I'm planning to start HRT as soon as fucking possible, so as of bow I'm like a femboy/beta protype trans girl experimental developer mode :sob:

• 🎮 Also working on a big Doom mod.

EDIT: All done, working on a website for it, which I'll link here when it's done, so you can learn more ab the whole thing, and I don't plan to release it for a good few months.
